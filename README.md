# Electric Dreams

A theme for Playnite, based on the
[Helium](https://github.com/darklinkpower/Helium) theme by darklinkpower.

## How do I download it?

This theme has deliberately not been added to the Playnite plugin library. It's
a personal theme, which means I made it for me and me only.

You're more than welcome to clone the repository and add it to your
`%APPDATA%/Playnite/Themes/Desktop` folder, which will automatically make it
available in Playnite itself, but there will be:

* no consistent updates to this theme
* no support for bugs or other issues
* no feature requests

For instance, I primarily use the Details view, so the Grid/List views may be
somewhat neglected and have inferior design/user experience as a result.

Of course, if you like the theme and would like to change things, feel free to
create a fork.
